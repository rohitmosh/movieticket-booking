# 🎬 Movie Ticket Booking System (OOP-based Java Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a **Movie Ticket Booking System** developed using **Object-Oriented Programming principles in Java**. The system streamlines the movie booking process by providing features such as movie selection, seat booking, multithreaded ticket confirmation, and basic user management. The project showcases real-world application of OOP concepts along with multithreading, exception handling, and JDBC connectivity (extendable).

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **User Authentication** – Register and log in as a user.
- 🎞️ **Browse Movies** – View list of available movies and showtimes.
- 🪑 **Seat Selection** – Choose from available seats.
- 🎟️ **Ticket Booking** – Confirm your booking with multithreaded processing.
- ⚠️ **Custom Exception Handling** – For managing booking errors.
- 🔄 **Concurrent Booking Handling** – Thread-safe implementation using multithreading.
- 🗃️ **Modular Design** – Clean class structure using OOP.
- 🛢️ **Database Integration Ready** – JDBC structure included for future database integration (currently uses in-memory logic).

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Java SE** (Core Java)
- **OOP Principles** (Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- **Multithreading** – For handling multiple bookings concurrently.
- **Custom Exceptions** – Robust error handling via `CustomException.java`.
- **Java Collections Framework**
- **JDBC** – (planned for database connectivity)
- **CLI-Based UI** (extendable to JavaFX GUI)
